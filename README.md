# Valorant Front-End Website

Welcome to my fun little project! This is a Valorant-themed website that I built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **GSAP** for some cool animations. It's my attempt at creating a visually appealing, interactive site that showcases the game's characters, maps, and updates. I'm still learning and experimenting with different features, so this is definitely a work in progress!

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For the front-end structure
- **TailwindCSS**: For easy, responsive styling
- **GSAP**: For all the animations you see on the site

## Getting Started

If you'd like to check out the project on your own machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/valorant-website.git
